# Ben Jervis Portfolio 

 # Description
This is the portfolio that I created for module challenge 2. This was the most difficult thing I have done in the course so far. 

 # Setup/Installation Requirements
First, I created and cloned the repository to my desktop. Then created my file structure and created my HTML bolier plate. I then created my CSS file. 

I used a number of websites to help me including: 
www.3schools.com
Youtube 
www.freecodecamp.com
Resources provided by University of Birmingham bootcamp
